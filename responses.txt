Yesterday I woke up early and went for a short walk. After that I had breakfast and worked on a few tasks at home.
My favorite childhood memory is playing cricket with my friends after school during the evenings.
This week I plan to finish my assignments and spend some time exercising in the evenings.
To make a cup of tea, first boil some water, then add tea leaves and let it steep before adding milk.
The last movie I watched was a comedy, and I really enjoyed the storyline and the acting.
I like my hometown because it is peaceful and the people are friendly.
One morning I met a friend unexpectedly at the market and we talked for a long time.
Last weekend I mostly stayed at home and relaxed, watching television and reading.
